This is a simulation of photon propagation through optical environments:
Pre-requisites: root. It will work very well even on your local machine. 

To run: 

root -l 'Simulation.C("particle",number_of_identical_particles)'
root -l 'Simulation.C("MIP",1)'  
root -l 'Simulation.C("proton",1)'
root -l 'Simulation.C("alpha",1)'  

More details/cleanup to come.
